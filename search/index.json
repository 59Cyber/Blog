[{"content":"Introduction Yep, You read that right! This post is dedicated to creating a website completely free using Hugo and Github. Infact, this post is going to be about how this very site was set up. This how to is aimed at individuals who have little coding experience/ understanding – thought I’d get that out of the way – but most of it is self explanatory and easy to use once setup.\nWhat Is Hugo and Github Pages Hugo is a open source static site generator written in the programming language Go. It allows users to develop and deploy their sites to hosting platforms but also allows users to run and test the site locally. Github Pages is a method of changing a Github repository into a website, with no server and database configuration – Sites are automatically built and published when the repository is updated. Github users are able to host their site from a personolised URL using their username. Github pages does provide templated themes, however, using hugo we can adchieve a more stylish looking site.\nStatic VS Dynamic Websites Depending on the purpose of your website, it will dictate whether you have a static or dynamic website. A static website is a site that is the same for all users regardless of who they are, where they are, or the time of day – the most simple form of a site. On the other hand, a dynamic website is the latter and tailors content to the user on a verairty of factors. Because of this, static sites are much more responsive and light weight than dynamic websites. Examples of websites are:\n   Static Dynamic     Blogs Shopping sites   Protfolioes Social media   News Sites Banking    These days its common to have a hybrid approach where both methods are used. For example, a news site dynamically shows related news to a region, but everyone in the region sees the same news.\nRequirements The following section will outline what will be required to set up the site. For the development of this site, I used Windows 10. This is important because it needs additional configuration unlike Linux and MacOS where some of the requirements have been set.\nHugo Go Git Text Editor GitHub Configuration Creating The Site Finding And Applying A Theme Done!?
